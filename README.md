# Pokemon-Encounter-Game
This project is a retro-style Pokémon page that allows users to encounter Pokémon in various locations, battle them, and expand their collection. During the game, users can access data on different Pokémon through the PokéApi and encounter wild Pokémon in different environments. 

**Technologies Used:**
1. **API:**
PokéApi: This API allows access to Pokémon data (e.g., names, types, moves, stats) and different locations.
2. **Frontend:**
React.js: Used to create an interactive user experience and implement various game features (e.g., location selection, battle mechanics).
3. **Design:**
NES-style CSS Framework: Provides the retro, 8-bit look for the game.
